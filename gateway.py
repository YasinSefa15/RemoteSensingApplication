# Gateway:
# The gateway is an application that reads values from the sensors and sends them,
# along with their timestamps, to the server. Additionally, the gateway monitors sensor activities.
# If the temperature sensor fails to send any values for 3 seconds,
# a 'TEMP SENSOR OFF' message will be sent to the server. Similarly,
# if an 'ALIVE' message is not received from the humidity sensor for more than 7 seconds,
# a 'HUMIDITY SENSOR OFF' message will be sent to the server.
